# SpamEmailClassifier

## Objective
To conduct the comparative Analysis on Spam Email Classisfication Model

## DataSet

## Process Folowed
- Data Preprocessing: Preparing Data for modeling like cleaning data by removing special charaters and lower cassing
    -  Data is processed in two parts: one section have stop words and another don't as some model words well with stop words like BERT and some don't ans they act as noise to them, exalple Naive Bayes works well without stop Perds
- Vectorisation: Considering models word on numeric values hence we have to convert to array of numbers. For this project we are using TF-IDF
- Modeling: All models are trained on both set of data With Stop words and without stop words.
    - Naive Bayes
    - SVM
